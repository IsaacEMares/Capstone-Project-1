        <h1>About me | Contact Me</h1>
        
        <p>My name is <u><strong>Isaac Eleazar Mares</strong></u>, <br/>
            I was born on <u>June 30th, 2001, in Corpus Christi, Texas</u>.
            I am <u>23 years old</u> pursuing a Front-End Development Career.
             I have been dodging my creative side for so long and I think pursuing this career would definitely bring that out.<br/>
            Also creating websites sounds so cool and the accomplishment from it must feel rewarding, plus I'll be getting paid for something I love doing.
            <br/>
            I have a dog named <u>Snoopy</u>, he's a chihuahua mix and I think he's unique in some way, he does this thing where
            he kind of lunches at you, trying to psych you out, it's so funny.
            He is about to turn 2 years old in human years, and I'm glad he's been in my life cause he has brought me
         and my family so much joy, <u>I love him to death</u>.
