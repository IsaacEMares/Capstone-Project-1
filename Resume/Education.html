        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>I went to school up until the last year of high school, then I dropped out to get my <u>Ged</u>.<br/>
        I decided to dropout cause of the amount of credits I needed to graduate, I was technically still a <u>sophomore</u><br/>
        and thought it would be smarter to go the <u>Ged</u> route rather then spend another year or two trying to graduate.
        Luckily I got my <u>Ged</u> the year I was supposed to graduate, <u>I got my Ged in March of 2020</u>.
        <br/> 
        <p>I'd say maybe a year later, I ended up going to <u>Community College</u> but not for long. <u>College</u> math got to me<br/>
        and I just stopped pursing <u>College</u> after that.</p>
